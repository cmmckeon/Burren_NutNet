# Burren_NutNet

This repository is for the code and data files used in the Burren_NutNet project producing an analysis of the effects of agricultural intensification and abandonment on high diversity grasslands in the Burren National Park, Ireland.

The 00_burren_code.Rmd markdown is for compiling, cleaning, handling, analysing and visualising the data.

Code written (with help from the open source commmunity at stack overflow) by Caroline McKeon, funded by Irish Research Council Government of Ireland Postgraduate Scholarship award GOIPG/2018/475.
